1
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:14,670
(For generations, humans have sought out

2
00:00:14,686 --> 00:00:16,401
tricks to make their longing for love a reality.)

3
00:00:17,794 --> 00:00:20,520
(One of the most favored and easiest tricks

4
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:21,560
is to write down your crush's name on an eraser.)

5
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:24,021
(Shone.)
is to write down your crush's name on an eraser.)

6
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:25,970
(Shone.)

7
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:30,608
(Then, with the power of the eraser,

8
00:00:32,252 --> 00:00:36,907
you and that person…

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,083
will fall in love forever.)

10
00:01:34,418 --> 00:01:35,652
(Her name is Mudmee.)

11
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:39,264
(She makes it clear to me

12
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:43,707
that angels are real.)

13
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:53,759
There are 9,999 roses out there but I’ve got only one here.

14
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:53,918
VALENTINE’S DAY LAST YEAR...
There are 9,999 roses out there but I’ve got only one here.

15
00:01:53,918 --> 00:01:53,928
VALENTINE’S DAY LAST YEAR...

16
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:55,150
It comes straight from my heart.
VALENTINE’S DAY LAST YEAR...

17
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:55,352
VALENTINE’S DAY LAST YEAR...

18
00:01:55,353 --> 00:01:57,014
Happy Valentine’s, babe.
VALENTINE’S DAY LAST YEAR...

19
00:01:57,015 --> 00:01:57,510
VALENTINE’S DAY LAST YEAR...

20
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:59,749
Oh, shut up.
VALENTINE’S DAY LAST YEAR...

21
00:01:59,750 --> 00:01:59,930
VALENTINE’S DAY LAST YEAR...

22
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:02,499
I have a little something for you too, honey.

23
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,818
Help me finish it. I’ve got a lot this year.

24
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,737
Here.

25
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,452
Gosh. I wish I weren’t this hot.

26
00:02:18,668 --> 00:02:19,814
- Half. - What?

27
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:23,526
Finish it yourself.

28
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,207
I hope you get diabetes.

29
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:26,019
What?

30
00:02:29,195 --> 00:02:29,864
Atom.

31
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:31,494
Atom.

32
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:44,143
Would you like a cupcake?

33
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,865
We made a lot in our Home Economics Club.

34
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:50,602
You can grab one if you don’t mind.

35
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,114
Can I really have it?

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,133
Sure.

37
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:56,366
But if you don’t want it, it’s fine.

38
00:02:56,383 --> 00:02:57,360
Hold on.

39
00:02:58,205 --> 00:02:58,867
Of course, I do.

40
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:02,553
Hey.

41
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,409
It’s good.

42
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,462
Really?

43
00:03:08,156 --> 00:03:09,006
That’s a relief.

44
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:11,006
Afraid it wouldn’t be likable.

45
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:13,110
(Oh, very likable.)

46
00:03:14,464 --> 00:03:15,615
(Totally likable.)

47
00:03:23,073 --> 00:03:28,366
(If I write my crush's name on an eraser,

48
00:03:33,053 --> 00:03:37,803
it will have the power to bind me and Mudmee

49
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:43,645
in love

50
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:46,840
for eternity.)

51
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,482
Hi, guys.

52
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:18,409
Books go under your desk.

53
00:04:19,621 --> 00:04:20,614
Let’s take some quiz.

54
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,200
No!

55
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:23,821
Are you kidding?

56
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,926
Oh, come on.

57
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:27,651
Pass this around. Return me what’s left.

58
00:04:28,955 --> 00:04:29,921
Where is it?

59
00:04:33,017 --> 00:04:33,803
Hey.

60
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:34,925
Hm?

61
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,271
Can I borrow your eraser?

62
00:04:37,352 --> 00:04:38,855
I’ve only got one.

63
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:41,107
You can rub it with your finger.

64
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:42,576
Break it in half.

65
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:44,413
I can’t. My mom just bought me this.

66
00:04:44,713 --> 00:04:45,384
Atom.

67
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:52,086
You can borrow mine.

68
00:04:54,156 --> 00:04:55,236
I have two.

69
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,402
Don’t worry about it.

70
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,227
(Gosh, she has the kindest heart.)

71
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:13,458
(I can’t help but fall, can I?)

72
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:17,912
(Wait.)

73
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,970
(Kongthap.)

74
00:05:19,412 --> 00:05:20,857
(You’ve got to be kidding me.)

75
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,021
(Does it mean Mudmee likes…

76
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:25,607
Kongthap?)

77
00:05:28,698 --> 00:05:30,081
(When did she even fall for him?)

78
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,329
(I had no clue.)

79
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:34,883
(Mudmee is Mudmee.)

80
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:36,609
(She’s so skilled at keeping secrets.)

81
00:05:37,187 --> 00:05:39,500
(Oh boy, I wish I didn’t see it.)

82
00:05:49,504 --> 00:05:50,090
Hold on.

83
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:52,400
Why is my name on that eraser?

84
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:53,808
And there’s a heart too.

85
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,178
Ah.

86
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,980
It’s not mine.

87
00:05:58,347 --> 00:05:59,110
Whose is it then?

88
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:06,206
It’s Mudmee’s.

89
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:08,310
What?

90
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:10,460
Mudmee likes Kongthap?

91
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:13,633
I’d managed to keep that secret for so long.

92
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:15,212
You’re so mean, Atom.

93
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:16,590
I hate you.

94
00:06:21,856 --> 00:06:22,753
Mudmee.

95
00:06:36,982 --> 00:06:37,978
So whose eraser is it?

96
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:40,502
Alright.

97
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,510
It’s mine.

98
00:06:43,107 --> 00:06:43,664
What?

99
00:06:44,295 --> 00:06:44,911
Over there.

100
00:06:45,181 --> 00:06:46,412
Hurry up and finish the quiz.

101
00:06:47,026 --> 00:06:48,092
No chatting.

102
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:52,083
Chop-chop.

103
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:57,846
(Goodbye, Mudmee.)

104
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:16,969
(This is all your fault, Kongthap!)

105
00:08:19,381 --> 00:08:20,246
Thank you.

106
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:24,353
Hey. Time is almost up.

107
00:08:24,898 --> 00:08:25,817
Hand it in already.

108
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,572
(I just don’t get it.)

109
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,375
(When did he even like me?)

110
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,926
(The last time we spoke…)

111
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:45,920
Kongthap.

112
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:48,309
Can I copy your Math homework?

113
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,122
I didn’t understand a thing the teacher said.

114
00:08:51,222 --> 00:08:52,122
Yeah, sure.

115
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,501
(Wait. And the day before that…)

116
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:56,181
Kongthap.

117
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:58,724
Can I copy your Physics assignment?

118
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:00,111
So difficult.

119
00:09:01,302 --> 00:09:02,339
(And then, on that day…)

120
00:09:02,644 --> 00:09:03,363
Kongthap.

121
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,980
Can I copy your Chemistry assignment?

122
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,104
I’ll cover the cleaning duty for you.

123
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,104
Next time you fall behind, let me know. I’ll teach you.

124
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,616
You’re so nice.

125
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,522
Impressive.

126
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:15,411
(So asking to copy my homework is just a cover-up.)

127
00:09:16,537 --> 00:09:18,615
(He’s actually been hitting on me.)

128
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:20,857
(I just never noticed that.)

129
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:35,509
- Atom. - Oh, shit!

130
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,378
Ah.

131
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:42,715
Mudmee.

132
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:43,593
Yes, it’s me.

133
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:46,067
My eraser.

134
00:09:46,707 --> 00:09:48,169
Are you done with it?

135
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:50,966
Right. I am.

136
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:52,261
I’m gonna hit the bathroom.

137
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,033
Hold on.

138
00:09:55,435 --> 00:09:56,104
Did you…

139
00:09:57,438 --> 00:09:58,603
see it?

140
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,952
What?

141
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:01,947
No, I didn’t.

142
00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:03,808
I didn’t see anything.

143
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:05,566
I knew it.

144
00:10:06,498 --> 00:10:08,153
You did see it.

145
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,076
Mudmee, I’m sorry.

146
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,559
I really didn’t mean to.

147
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:25,415
It’s alright.

148
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:30,126
I’m thankful enough that you don’t tease me.

149
00:10:36,588 --> 00:10:38,461
I’ve never liked anyone before.

150
00:10:38,984 --> 00:10:40,461
So I tried the trick.

151
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:46,021
I feel you.

152
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:51,618
First love is truly tough.

153
00:10:53,243 --> 00:10:54,448
But if it’s you,

154
00:10:54,685 --> 00:10:59,550
I’m sure he will never say no.

155
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:01,504
I doubt it.

156
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:06,807
For someone like him, there has to be someone he already likes.

157
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:12,042
As for me, I’m happy enough observing him from afar.

158
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:14,406
Anyway,

159
00:11:15,932 --> 00:11:20,863
can you promise to keep this between us?

160
00:11:23,551 --> 00:11:24,161
Sure.

161
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,563
It’s a secret between…

162
00:11:28,609 --> 00:11:29,207
Hold on.

163
00:11:30,027 --> 00:11:31,236
Why is my name on that eraser?

164
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:32,563
And there’s a heart too.

165
00:11:37,103 --> 00:11:37,693
Atom?

166
00:11:37,877 --> 00:11:38,720
You okay?

167
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:43,912
You haven’t told anyone about this, have you?

168
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:45,775
Atom?

169
00:11:49,218 --> 00:11:49,909
Atom…

170
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,445
Been looking for you.

171
00:11:52,843 --> 00:11:53,498
- About the eraser… - Hey!

172
00:11:55,068 --> 00:11:55,920
No one else knows about this.

173
00:11:55,938 --> 00:11:57,793
If you’ll excuse me, I need to use the bathroom.

174
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:11,014
Uh…

175
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:12,709
About that eraser.

176
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,215
- Don’t tell anyone. - I’m sorry.

177
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:21,977
Are you not confessing your feelings for me?

178
00:12:22,596 --> 00:12:23,409
Oh, please.

179
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:28,609
I’m asking you not to tell anyone about this.

180
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:30,152
I don’t want to hear any teasing.

181
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:32,902
You don’t have to ask me.

182
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,805
Who would tease anyone about this important matter?

183
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,206
Why are you such a good guy?

184
00:12:45,323 --> 00:12:46,167
That’s why…

185
00:12:52,197 --> 00:12:53,198
you’re liked.

186
00:12:55,447 --> 00:12:56,016
What?

187
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,312
I’m sorry if I did something that led you on.

188
00:13:01,123 --> 00:13:02,807
No, I didn’t mean it that way.

189
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:03,864
I meant…

190
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:05,388
What?

191
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,006
Whatever.

192
00:13:09,219 --> 00:13:11,206
Can you just forget about all this?

193
00:13:12,513 --> 00:13:13,132
Wait.

194
00:13:14,822 --> 00:13:15,907
Will you be okay?

195
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,217
Why do I need to forget it?

196
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:23,402
Even though I turned you down, it doesn’t mean your feelings are worthless.

197
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:32,630
They’re not mine.

198
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,405
I’m sorry.

199
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:56,395
But from now on, if you ever need any help, you can just tell me.

200
00:13:56,499 --> 00:13:57,286
Don’t feel like you can’t.

201
00:14:01,972 --> 00:14:02,899
I’m willing to help.

202
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,906
Can I punch you in the face?

203
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,133
What?

204
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:15,343
Hold on.

205
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:16,051
Not like this.

206
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:16,754
I said it wrong.

207
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,181
Wait.

208
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:18,925
Take it easy.

209
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,461
Would you like a cupcake?

210
00:14:27,224 --> 00:14:29,530
You can grab one if you don’t mind.

211
00:14:29,923 --> 00:14:31,506
Afraid it wouldn’t be likable.

212
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:35,207
So those cupcakes were for you.

213
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:39,115
I get it now.

214
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:48,833
Hey!

215
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,733
Call me stupid if you want.

216
00:14:51,883 --> 00:14:53,107
But despite the outcome,

217
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:56,212
my feelings continue.

218
00:14:57,574 --> 00:14:58,695
You can’t change my mind.

219
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:17,610
Gosh, he’s so smitten with me.

220
00:15:35,707 --> 00:15:36,323
Mudmee.

221
00:15:36,691 --> 00:15:37,504
Hey, Atom.

222
00:15:39,101 --> 00:15:39,980
May I sit with you?

223
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,524
Of course. Sit.

224
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:52,614
Mudmee.

225
00:15:54,104 --> 00:15:54,707
What’s up?

226
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:56,236
Can I ask you something?

227
00:15:57,793 --> 00:15:58,585
Sure. What is it?

228
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,805
Well…

229
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:05,702
Why do you like him?

230
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,019
Seriously, Atom?

231
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:14,021
Please.

232
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:16,410
I want to know.

233
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:18,019
Please.

234
00:16:20,303 --> 00:16:21,201
Um…

235
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:24,214
Why do I like him?

236
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:26,901
I guess he’s cool.

237
00:16:35,498 --> 00:16:36,866
He’s also kind.

238
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:46,623
More importantly, I like someone who doesn’t give up easily.

239
00:16:50,212 --> 00:16:51,812
Doesn’t give up easily?

240
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,409
Right.

241
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:12,018
Guys, listen up.

242
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,307
Find yourself a partner.

243
00:17:14,697 --> 00:17:17,293
Next week, we’re playing doubles.

244
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:21,056
And you’re allowed to choose your opponent.

245
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,005
Let’s go.

246
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:29,763
Hey.

247
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:30,730
Atom.

248
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:33,163
We’re pairing, right?

249
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,454
Who should we play?

250
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:36,760
How about Cooper?

251
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,309
He’s huge. Should be slow.

252
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:49,565
You!

253
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,058
Hm?

254
00:17:55,571 --> 00:17:56,633
We’re playing you.

255
00:18:01,856 --> 00:18:02,501
Come here.

256
00:18:04,211 --> 00:18:05,673
Are you out of your mind?

257
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,565
Kongthap is on the school team.

258
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,772
That’s basketball, not badminton.

259
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,930
Come on.

260
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,573
He’s better than us at any sport, dude.

261
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,809
We pant so hard just walking up the stairs.

262
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:23,738
I’m the kind of guy who doesn’t give up easily.

263
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,894
Let’s practice this evening.

264
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:31,630
I have to beat him.

265
00:18:33,101 --> 00:18:34,582
For goodness’ sake.

266
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,321
Focus.

267
00:18:51,322 --> 00:18:53,015
We must become the province’s number one this year.

268
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,661
Hey, Thap.

269
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:10,849
What’s the matter?

270
00:19:13,373 --> 00:19:14,110
Sorry.

271
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,344
You’ve never been this distracted before.

272
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,018
Well…

273
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:20,873
I’ve been…

274
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:21,850
Are you sick?

275
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:25,304
No. I…

276
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,389
Don’t push too hard.

277
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:27,782
You’re the best on our team.

278
00:19:27,796 --> 00:19:30,671
As your captain, I order you to go home and rest.

279
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,324
Just rest, man.

280
00:19:56,184 --> 00:19:56,925
Hey.

281
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:00,667
What is it?

282
00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:04,063
Someone left a cat here.

283
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,142
A cat this cute?

284
00:20:10,572 --> 00:20:13,427
Let me post its photo in a cat adoption group.

285
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:14,774
Sure.

286
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,003
Half.

287
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:22,347
You and Atom are close, right?

288
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:28,561
Not that I want to be.

289
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,906
I can’t help it.

290
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:32,798
We’ve sat next to each other since Grade 10.

291
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,016
Why are you asking?

292
00:20:35,507 --> 00:20:36,646
What’s he like?

293
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:40,101
What’s he like?

294
00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:42,508
Like what you see.

295
00:20:43,145 --> 00:20:45,775
He’s dorky and confused.

296
00:20:46,502 --> 00:20:48,031
When something happens, he’s the first to run away.

297
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:50,661
Does he have a crush on someone right now?

298
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:54,431
Even if he does, he won’t tell me.

299
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:56,211
He’s afraid I’ll tease him.

300
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:00,449
Why are you asking though, Kongthap?

301
00:21:04,116 --> 00:21:04,902
Don’t tell me

302
00:21:08,472 --> 00:21:10,191
Atom is after someone you’re with.

303
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:11,551
Is he?

304
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:12,602
No, it’s not that.

305
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:15,711
It’s just that we’ve been in the same class forever,

306
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:17,992
yet I don’t know him at all.

307
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:22,021
Speaking of him,

308
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,030
I have a badminton practice with him this evening.

309
00:21:24,357 --> 00:21:25,954
But I also have dinner with my dad.

310
00:21:28,137 --> 00:21:29,313
You can take a rain check with your dad.

311
00:21:30,152 --> 00:21:30,944
I can’t.

312
00:21:31,276 --> 00:21:32,618
He’s a soldier.

313
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:37,106
If I don’t go, I sure will be disciplined.

314
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:38,558
It’s almost time.

315
00:21:41,347 --> 00:21:42,620
What am I gonna do?

316
00:21:55,664 --> 00:21:56,908
What took you so long?

317
00:21:57,335 --> 00:21:59,400
With this lack of commitment, how can we beat Kongthap?

318
00:22:03,838 --> 00:22:04,460
Hey!

319
00:22:10,137 --> 00:22:11,011
Why are you here?

320
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,061
Half’s got something urgent.

321
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,808
He asked me to practice with you.

322
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:28,354
Wait a minute.

323
00:22:28,851 --> 00:22:31,515
Practice with you to compete against you?

324
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:33,270
What was he thinking?

325
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:34,863
Don’t see a problem with that.

326
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:36,863
We can help each other study for other subjects.

327
00:22:37,538 --> 00:22:39,713
But this is PE.

328
00:22:40,285 --> 00:22:41,566
One must win

329
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:43,468
and one must lose.

330
00:22:44,191 --> 00:22:45,406
Don’t think of it that way.

331
00:22:46,475 --> 00:22:50,371
The key to PE classes is sportsmanship.

332
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:55,272
I’m not talking to you.

333
00:22:57,136 --> 00:22:57,803
Fine then.

334
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:04,076
I can gauge your skill level by practicing with you.

335
00:23:04,612 --> 00:23:06,502
I haven’t played in a long time.

336
00:23:06,656 --> 00:23:08,810
The last time must be when I was in elementary school.

337
00:23:09,234 --> 00:23:12,611
I play badminton with my mom every week.

338
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:13,778
I guess

339
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:17,058
you’re flunking PE this year.

340
00:23:29,486 --> 00:23:30,110
Hey!

341
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:35,071
Hey, you.

342
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:36,606
You said you hadn’t played in a long time.

343
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:37,610
Right.

344
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:40,267
Still trying to get a handle on it.

345
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:43,159
You see, my ankle feels sore.

346
00:23:44,538 --> 00:23:45,538
I suppose I landed in the wrong position.

347
00:23:46,854 --> 00:23:47,666
(Calm down.)

348
00:23:47,794 --> 00:23:49,218
(If you can’t use your physical strength,

349
00:23:50,288 --> 00:23:51,307
use your brain.)

350
00:23:56,952 --> 00:24:00,409
(I’ll lure him to the left, but hit it to the right.)

351
00:24:03,035 --> 00:24:03,710
Hey!

352
00:24:05,992 --> 00:24:06,650
(Well then…)

353
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,011
(I’ll pretend to drop, but hit it to the back.)

354
00:24:13,055 --> 00:24:13,708
Ow!

355
00:24:14,247 --> 00:24:15,097
Come on.

356
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:17,097
Will you ever be deceived?

357
00:24:17,578 --> 00:24:19,008
Don’t you have any weaknesses?

358
00:24:19,737 --> 00:24:20,421
I do.

359
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:24,076
The guys on the basketball team said I was too serious.

360
00:24:25,621 --> 00:24:27,910
Yeah, what a terrible weakness.

361
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,781
Should we call it a day then?

362
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,808
We shouldn’t practice too hard.

363
00:24:32,144 --> 00:24:32,873
Wait.

364
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:34,873
I haven’t done collecting your skill info.

365
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,243
It’s just a PE test.

366
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:39,612
Why do you want to beat me so bad?

367
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:43,426
Then…

368
00:24:44,387 --> 00:24:45,209
let’s eat.

369
00:24:46,021 --> 00:24:46,863
I’m paying.

370
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:54,069
I don’t believe you don’t have weaknesses at all.

371
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,109
Here you go.

372
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:08,543
Don’t like your food spicy?

373
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,133
No.

374
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,104
My mom doesn’t cook strong-tasting food.

375
00:25:13,248 --> 00:25:13,815
There.

376
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:15,710
I’ve found your weakness.

377
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:17,270
Watch and learn, kid.

378
00:25:27,216 --> 00:25:27,947
Ma’am.

379
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:29,708
I ordered no veggies.

380
00:25:29,939 --> 00:25:30,851
Sorry about that.

381
00:25:31,435 --> 00:25:32,410
Just toss them aside.

382
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,913
I don’t eat vegetables.

383
00:25:40,182 --> 00:25:41,412
I mean when I was young.

384
00:25:41,817 --> 00:25:44,813
Right now, they’re my favorite.

385
00:25:47,234 --> 00:25:47,927
Don’t believe me?

386
00:25:48,383 --> 00:25:49,113
I’ll show you.

387
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:13,835
It’s so good.

388
00:26:24,564 --> 00:26:26,253
Hey, what are you doing?

389
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:27,692
May I have them?

390
00:26:28,351 --> 00:26:29,100
I like vegetables.

391
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:30,289
But they’re mine.

392
00:26:31,177 --> 00:26:31,966
In exchange for this.

393
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:37,257
Fine.

394
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,343
I’ll eat the barbecued pork for you.

395
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,570
(Sriracha Wonton Noodle Soup with Barbequed Pork)

396
00:27:00,975 --> 00:27:03,113
The chili powder here is quite hot.

397
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:29,776
Thanks.

398
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,991
For what?

399
00:27:35,992 --> 00:27:39,405
For practicing with me.

400
00:27:41,456 --> 00:27:42,618
It’s cool. Don’t mention it.

401
00:27:45,637 --> 00:27:46,656
By the way,

402
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,436
your racket is too heavy. Too hard to swing.

403
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,723
Use this.

404
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,912
What are you gonna use for the test tomorrow?

405
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:03,064
I have my dad’s racket at home.

406
00:28:04,028 --> 00:28:08,659
And he’s just gone.

407
00:28:26,726 --> 00:28:27,403
Hey.

408
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:29,805
I’m sorry.

409
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,419
What? No.

410
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,978
I mean he’s gone to Japan for work.

411
00:28:37,165 --> 00:28:38,262
He’s rarely home.

412
00:28:38,464 --> 00:28:39,030
What?

413
00:28:39,323 --> 00:28:40,400
Come on.

414
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:43,098
Why didn’t you say it clearly?

415
00:28:44,368 --> 00:28:45,803
What a drama king.

416
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,452
He bought me as a birthday present.

417
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:50,516
My name is on it.

418
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,160
(Kongthap)

419
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:57,449
(It holds sentimental value.)
(Kongthap)

420
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:57,707
(It holds sentimental value.)

421
00:28:59,402 --> 00:29:00,514
(Yet he lends it to me.)

422
00:29:02,578 --> 00:29:03,302
(Fine.)

423
00:29:04,283 --> 00:29:08,146
(I’m done questioning why Mudmee likes you.)

424
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:10,508
You.

425
00:29:11,503 --> 00:29:12,508
Can you stop being nice?

426
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,515
Why?

427
00:29:16,837 --> 00:29:17,713
Let’s just say

428
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:19,606
I don’t like it.

429
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:23,497
You will regret lending me your racket.

430
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,050
PE ASSESSMENT DAY

431
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,266
Do your best.

432
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,156
We can’t let Kongthap win.

433
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:08,304
Atom.

434
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,196
Have you got a partner?

435
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,364
I’m partnering with Half.

436
00:30:16,095 --> 00:30:18,982
- Right. - You haven’t had a partner?

437
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:21,520
I actually partnered with Namkaeng.

438
00:30:21,702 --> 00:30:25,101
But she’s sick today, so the teacher told me to find a new partner.

439
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:27,618
Monticha.

440
00:30:28,342 --> 00:30:29,609
I’ve found you a new partner.

441
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:31,302
Who is it?

442
00:30:32,938 --> 00:30:33,660
Kongthap.

443
00:30:33,995 --> 00:30:35,222
His partner is absent as well.

444
00:30:36,691 --> 00:30:37,509
What a relief.

445
00:30:37,775 --> 00:30:39,138
I thought I wouldn’t get a new partner.

446
00:30:54,316 --> 00:30:56,021
Let’s…fight!

447
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:06,913
Go, Atom.

448
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:09,900
Ow!

449
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:11,840
No.

450
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:12,922
Yeah!

451
00:31:13,322 --> 00:31:14,626
We got the point.

452
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,324
Half, you asshole.

453
00:31:18,569 --> 00:31:20,312
Don’t attack Mudmee.

454
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,807
But you said we must win.

455
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,035
I have to go for their weakness.

456
00:31:25,273 --> 00:31:28,750
I know, but can you hit it right at Kongthap?

457
00:31:29,364 --> 00:31:30,019
Come on.

458
00:32:01,604 --> 00:32:02,522
It’s the match point.

459
00:32:03,132 --> 00:32:05,310
If Kongthap’s team gets the point, they win.

460
00:32:05,729 --> 00:32:06,333
Ready?

461
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,411
Atom.

462
00:32:09,633 --> 00:32:11,607
I think Kongthap is moving weird.

463
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:16,611
At practice, he said his leg felt sore.

464
00:32:16,964 --> 00:32:18,572
Good. Let’s do this.

465
00:32:18,807 --> 00:32:20,155
I’ll draw him backcourt.

466
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:22,383
Once he returns it, you do a drop shot.

467
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,240
His leg hurts. He won’t make it in time.

468
00:32:24,463 --> 00:32:25,200
Are you sure?

469
00:32:25,216 --> 00:32:27,304
But you’re the one who wants to beat him.

470
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:40,611
Why do you like him?

471
00:32:40,766 --> 00:32:41,838
I guess he’s cool.

472
00:32:42,072 --> 00:32:45,307
More importantly, I like someone who doesn’t give up easily.

473
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:00,267
Half’s got something urgent.

474
00:33:00,339 --> 00:33:01,295
May I have them? I like vegetables.

475
00:33:01,308 --> 00:33:03,136
Your racket is too heavy. Use this.

476
00:33:14,716 --> 00:33:15,467
The game is over.

477
00:33:15,781 --> 00:33:18,140
Monticha and Kaweewat win.

478
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:19,690
Yeah! We win.

479
00:33:20,923 --> 00:33:21,601
Good job.

480
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,915
Why didn’t you do a drop shot as planned?

481
00:33:27,145 --> 00:33:28,418
I’m sorry.

482
00:33:35,566 --> 00:33:36,368
You did great.

483
00:33:37,011 --> 00:33:38,196
Awesome.

484
00:33:57,891 --> 00:33:59,103
Why didn’t you go for a drop shot?

485
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,163
If you did, I wouldn’t make it back in time.

486
00:34:12,753 --> 00:34:13,812
I wanted to win,

487
00:34:15,017 --> 00:34:20,224
but someone once said that the key to PE classes is sportsmanship.

488
00:34:22,887 --> 00:34:23,639
Who did?

489
00:34:25,888 --> 00:34:26,566
Well said.

490
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:28,707
You did.

491
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,667
Here’s your racket.

492
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,793
Take it back.

493
00:34:58,371 --> 00:34:59,018
Hop on.

494
00:35:00,288 --> 00:35:00,828
It’s fine.

495
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:02,650
I have my bike.

496
00:35:03,844 --> 00:35:04,526
I know.

497
00:35:05,462 --> 00:35:08,813
But with that leg, you can’t bike.

498
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,128
Hop on.

499
00:35:44,496 --> 00:35:45,221
What is it?

500
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:48,822
Someone left a cat here the other day.

501
00:35:50,472 --> 00:35:52,247
Wondering if it’s been adopted already.

502
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:56,713
Well, it’s not here anymore.

503
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,911
I guess somebody has adopted it.

504
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,907
What are you looking at?

505
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,605
I wanted to adopt it, alright?

506
00:36:17,212 --> 00:36:19,018
But my mom wouldn’t allow it.

507
00:36:20,899 --> 00:36:23,360
I made it a shelter with my umbrella though.

508
00:36:24,452 --> 00:36:26,975
I know you don’t believe me.

509
00:36:29,036 --> 00:36:30,070
I do believe you, Atom.

510
00:36:35,317 --> 00:36:35,980
Yeah.

511
00:36:36,842 --> 00:36:37,606
Whatever.

512
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,742
I’m sorry.

513
00:38:35,186 --> 00:38:37,044
I hope someone nice adopts you.

514
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:45,207
Someone left a cat here.

515
00:39:11,637 --> 00:39:12,215
Here.

516
00:39:12,647 --> 00:39:13,408
It’s yours.

517
00:39:14,377 --> 00:39:15,977
The teacher got our workbooks mixed up again.

518
00:39:18,596 --> 00:39:19,369
Sorry about that.

519
00:39:21,124 --> 00:39:21,815
It’s okay.

520
00:39:22,324 --> 00:39:23,049
I’m used to it.

521
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:25,405
Our names are cool. We can’t help it.

522
00:39:41,106 --> 00:39:42,611
Hey, Atom.

523
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:47,901
You’re not gonna be close to him by doing this.

524
00:39:50,403 --> 00:39:51,107
You’re right.

525
00:39:52,704 --> 00:39:53,655
I know that.

526
00:39:53,672 --> 00:39:57,725
But every time I see him, I don’t know how to behave.

527
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:04,563
I get you.

528
00:40:06,123 --> 00:40:12,671
When I’m near someone I like, I don’t know how to act either.

529
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,707
So you’re liking someone too?

530
00:40:20,715 --> 00:40:21,672
Ah…

531
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:23,364
You can tell me.

532
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,410
I’m happy to listen to all of your stories.

533
00:40:31,043 --> 00:40:32,369
The one I like…

534
00:40:35,574 --> 00:40:36,504
Well…

535
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,406
Here.

536
00:40:52,108 --> 00:40:54,270
I just bought you a new eraser.

537
00:40:54,902 --> 00:40:57,477
If you’re not ready to tell me, it’s fine.

538
00:40:57,731 --> 00:40:58,404
I understand.

539
00:40:59,304 --> 00:41:02,614
But you can just write your crush’s name on it.

540
00:41:04,694 --> 00:41:06,961
I promise I won’t tell anyone.

541
00:41:08,114 --> 00:41:09,806
Just like that time you saved me.

542
00:41:15,778 --> 00:41:16,508
Thanks.

543
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:26,670
Why can’t I talk to him the way I talked to you just now?

544
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,310
(You can talk to me because you see me as a friend, Mudmee.)

545
00:42:03,408 --> 00:42:07,615
(From now on, I will try to see you as a friend as well.)

546
00:42:12,353 --> 00:42:12,884
Hey.

547
00:42:14,051 --> 00:42:14,653
No.

548
00:42:17,587 --> 00:42:18,457
Come on.

549
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,649
- Hey, what are you doing? - Ouch.

550
00:42:28,876 --> 00:42:29,504
Ouch.

551
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,911
Don’t go suicidal over something so little.

552
00:42:55,494 --> 00:42:56,175
Up.

553
00:42:59,894 --> 00:43:00,803
What are you talking about?

554
00:43:01,535 --> 00:43:02,941
I was climbing out there to get my eraser.

555
00:43:11,663 --> 00:43:14,966
Are you here to add insult to injury?

556
00:43:16,123 --> 00:43:16,806
No.

557
00:43:18,055 --> 00:43:20,092
I just saw you walking up here looking sad.

558
00:43:21,073 --> 00:43:23,818
I was afraid you’d think too much about the eraser thing.

559
00:43:24,233 --> 00:43:24,913
Oh, please.

560
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:28,258
I told you to forget about that.

561
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:30,422
I can’t.

562
00:43:31,913 --> 00:43:32,463
What?

563
00:43:35,222 --> 00:43:36,209
I tried.

564
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,611
But I just don’t understand

565
00:43:39,569 --> 00:43:42,710
how it feels

566
00:43:43,963 --> 00:43:45,670
to like someone.

567
00:43:51,055 --> 00:43:51,660
Wait a minute.

568
00:43:53,011 --> 00:43:57,209
Are you saying you’ve never liked anyone before?

569
00:44:05,092 --> 00:44:05,725
Yeah, so?

570
00:44:10,143 --> 00:44:11,977
I’ve never liked anyone before.

571
00:44:12,935 --> 00:44:16,415
For someone like him, there has to be someone he already likes.

572
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:18,410
So that means

573
00:44:19,388 --> 00:44:20,656
there’s still hope.

574
00:44:29,853 --> 00:44:30,703
Well.

575
00:44:32,221 --> 00:44:34,475
What is your type?

576
00:44:37,302 --> 00:44:40,232
Cute or cool?

577
00:44:42,502 --> 00:44:43,240
Cute, I guess.

578
00:44:46,443 --> 00:44:51,556
A tiny little cutie-patootie or someone as tall as you?

579
00:44:52,766 --> 00:44:53,604
I don’t mind.

580
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,201
Just don’t be taller than me.

581
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:02,406
Checked all the boxes.

582
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,818
But you’re not a tiny little cutie-patootie.

583
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:06,615
Hey.

584
00:45:06,857 --> 00:45:07,806
Will you excuse me?

585
00:45:08,575 --> 00:45:09,219
Bye.

586
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:09,983
Hold on.

587
00:45:17,343 --> 00:45:18,043
Atom.

588
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:21,510
Can you wait for my answer?

589
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:25,977
What answer?

590
00:45:28,069 --> 00:45:28,673
Well,

591
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:30,132
about your feelings for me.

592
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,396
I want to know more about you first

593
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,333
in order to give you the answer.

594
00:45:44,754 --> 00:45:45,980
Can you wait for me?

595
00:45:48,363 --> 00:45:49,494
I will give you the answer soon.

596
00:45:58,636 --> 00:45:59,254
What?

597
00:45:59,827 --> 00:46:00,602
What the heck?

598
00:46:02,754 --> 00:46:03,618
Can it be…

599
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,568
the power of the eraser?

600
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:09,320
Half’s got something urgent.

601
00:46:09,485 --> 00:46:09,956
No!

602
00:46:09,966 --> 00:46:10,646
I like vegetables.

603
00:46:10,661 --> 00:46:11,298
No!

604
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:13,433
No.

605
00:46:13,996 --> 00:46:14,609
No.

606
00:46:15,195 --> 00:46:15,829
No.

607
00:46:16,966 --> 00:46:17,603
No.

608
00:46:17,867 --> 00:46:18,501
No.

609
00:46:20,221 --> 00:46:20,807
No.

610
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:21,861
No.

611
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:26,549
No!

612
00:46:33,856 --> 00:46:36,855
We’ll be doing a play for the school event this year.

613
00:46:38,538 --> 00:46:39,201
Sorry.

614
00:46:39,293 --> 00:46:41,065
You missed basketball practice because of me.

615
00:46:41,474 --> 00:46:44,034
You’re kind. That’s why I wanted to help you.

616
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:46,472
Mudmee.

617
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:49,609
I once promised to help you with your love.

618
00:46:50,046 --> 00:46:50,815
I’m sorry.

619
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:52,473
I don’t think I can do it

620
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,166
if I still feel this way.
