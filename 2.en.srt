1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:02,552
(Write down your crush's name on an eraser.)

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,060
(Then, with the power of the eraser, you and that person…)

3
00:00:06,642 --> 00:00:08,598
(Mudmee likes Kongthap?)

4
00:00:09,534 --> 00:00:10,742
Why is my name on that eraser?

5
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:11,983
It’s mine, alright?

6
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:12,631
What?

7
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:14,020
Why do you like him?

8
00:00:14,245 --> 00:00:15,422
I guess he’s cool.

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,422
I like someone who doesn’t give up easily.

10
00:00:18,194 --> 00:00:19,422
Call me stupid if you want.

11
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:20,700
But despite the outcome,

12
00:00:20,765 --> 00:00:22,482
my feelings continue.

13
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:23,568
You can’t change my mind.

14
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,269
I want to know you better first.

15
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:27,312
Can you wait for my answer?

16
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,220
What answer?

17
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:29,355
About your feelings for me.

18
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:30,407
Can you wait for me?

19
00:00:30,426 --> 00:00:33,010
No!

20
00:00:37,256 --> 00:00:38,699
Guys, listen up.

21
00:00:39,488 --> 00:00:41,517
As your class president,

22
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,839
I've decided to organize a play for the school event this year.

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,239
(Stage play)
I've decided to organize a play for the school event this year.

24
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,330
(Stage play)

25
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:52,115
And the play we’re doing is Cinderella.

26
00:00:52,374 --> 00:00:56,463
However, we’ll adapt it to a Thai version called Destirella.

27
00:00:57,616 --> 00:01:00,100
And no one is more suitable to play the main characters

28
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:05,112
than our class’s lovebirds, Toon and Tan.

29
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:16,081
Thank you so much for choosing us, guys.

30
00:01:16,768 --> 00:01:19,931
I’m not much of an actor, Tan. Will you help me through it?

31
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:21,325
- No, you help me. - No. You.

32
00:01:21,337 --> 00:01:22,788
- No. You. - You, Tan.

33
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:23,977
- No. You. - You, Tan.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,109
Alright, there.

35
00:01:25,354 --> 00:01:27,008
Go help each other at home.

36
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:32,019
As for the rest of us, let’s divide into teams, starting from the art team.

37
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:33,309
Raise your hands if you want to do it.

38
00:01:33,863 --> 00:01:36,604
(I’m sorry, Mudmee, for causing you trouble.)

39
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:40,914
(I promise to do anything to get him to like you back.)

40
00:01:43,678 --> 00:01:44,306
Okay.

41
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:46,222
Oh.

42
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:48,308
No one else wants to do it?

43
00:01:53,576 --> 00:01:54,315
Kongthap.

44
00:01:55,164 --> 00:01:56,208
You should…

45
00:01:58,071 --> 00:01:59,042
join the art team.

46
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:01,090
Why?

47
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:02,718
Just go with it.

48
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,213
Kongthap wants to do it.

49
00:02:06,977 --> 00:02:07,659
Okay.

50
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,275
Then I’ll put down your names.

51
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:09,992
Yes.

52
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:11,506
Kongthap and Atom are on the art team.

53
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:13,216
Hey!

54
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,204
No Atom.

55
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:15,865
You raised your hand too.

56
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:17,802
Let’s move on to the costume team.

57
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,216
(No.)

58
00:02:19,562 --> 00:02:20,705
(The plan has gone wrong.)

59
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:26,272
(But at least he will get close to Mudmee.)

60
00:02:27,677 --> 00:02:34,306
(May the sweet moments spent preparing the play spark their love.)

61
00:02:34,628 --> 00:02:36,712
(Sadhu.)

62
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:38,210
What are you looking for?

63
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,662
I’m looking for the printer cable.

64
00:03:44,568 --> 00:03:45,278
Ah.

65
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:47,977
This model supports Wi-Fi printing from your phone.

66
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:50,743
Seriously?

67
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:54,164
Thanks.

68
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:06,407
Yeah.

69
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:07,866
Got it.

70
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:13,854
What are you painting?

71
00:04:14,346 --> 00:04:15,017
A cat paw?

72
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:19,438
Cat paw, my foot.

73
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,524
It’s a frangipani.

74
00:04:23,474 --> 00:04:25,120
Oh, sorry.

75
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:28,420
Even though I thought it was a cat paw, it was a nice cat paw.

76
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:29,794
Do not comfort me.

77
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:31,794
I know I’m not very good at it.

78
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:37,112
You know, I drew the Sun once and someone thought it was a fried egg.

79
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:38,514
Gosh.

80
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:51,922
Why won’t it close?

81
00:04:57,835 --> 00:04:59,167
Let’s see. Maybe it’s stuck.

82
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:03,112
Oh!

83
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,582
Well…

84
00:05:21,783 --> 00:05:22,491
Sorry.

85
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,585
Hey!

86
00:05:28,004 --> 00:05:28,762
Hi, Atom.

87
00:05:32,641 --> 00:05:34,108
Mudmee, you need a hand?

88
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,231
No, it’s fine.

89
00:05:35,508 --> 00:05:37,614
The stage team needs it now.

90
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:41,727
Mudmee.

91
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:43,825
Kongthap can help you with that.

92
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:45,445
I can.

93
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,680
It’s okay, Kongthap.

94
00:05:46,816 --> 00:05:47,485
Easy-peasy.

95
00:05:47,758 --> 00:05:49,108
I’ll be going now.

96
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,122
- Oops.
- Hey!

97
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,342
That was close.

98
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:58,078
Half, why did you even come?

99
00:05:58,386 --> 00:05:58,918
What?

100
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:00,613
I came to help.

101
00:06:01,045 --> 00:06:03,826
Mudmee, let Kongthap and me handle this.

102
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,530
You should help Atom with the painting.

103
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:07,709
Half!

104
00:06:08,305 --> 00:06:08,937
What?

105
00:06:14,315 --> 00:06:14,961
Well.

106
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,817
I was gonna say you were such a good guy.

107
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:20,851
Thanks, man.

108
00:06:27,675 --> 00:06:28,512
Mudmee.

109
00:06:28,774 --> 00:06:29,860
Yeah. What’s up?

110
00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:31,454
I’m sorry.

111
00:06:32,216 --> 00:06:36,511
If I’d tried harder, you would’ve made more progress with him by now.

112
00:06:39,343 --> 00:06:40,574
Don’t worry, Atom.

113
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:43,982
You see, I already got to talk to him today.

114
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,607
It was worth it.

115
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:49,112
I’m serious.

116
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,170
By the way, we’ve been talking only about me.

117
00:06:59,644 --> 00:07:01,309
Why don’t we talk about you for a change?

118
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:03,208
What about me?

119
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:09,004
You told me you had a crush on someone.

120
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:17,524
Who is it?

121
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:22,050
Right.

122
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:31,567
Are you ready to tell me?

123
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:37,404
I’m all ears for you.

124
00:07:48,597 --> 00:07:49,205
- Hey.
- Hey.

125
00:07:49,945 --> 00:07:51,200
Shit!

126
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,120
A rag?

127
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:54,900
Yes. Can I get a rag or a cloth?

128
00:07:57,776 --> 00:07:58,440
No.

129
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:00,362
I’m making it worse.

130
00:08:00,602 --> 00:08:02,912
Atom, you shouldn’t use that rag anymore.

131
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:07,010
Did you spill the paint?

132
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:08,660
I’ll get some water.

133
00:08:08,724 --> 00:08:09,912
I’ll help you.

134
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,204
Yes. Let’s go.

135
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:13,309
Hey. What should I do?

136
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:14,663
It’s such a mess now.

137
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:16,361
Everyone worked so hard on it.

138
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:18,521
Calm down. It’s not a big deal. Let me help you.

139
00:08:18,595 --> 00:08:19,625
Can you get me the white paint?

140
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,765
We paint it white first, then other colors on top.

141
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:47,976
Yeah.

142
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,373
We’ve finished.

143
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,906
Right before the building is closed.

144
00:08:52,228 --> 00:08:52,857
Right.

145
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:54,217
Guys.

146
00:08:55,345 --> 00:08:57,859
I’m sorry for wasting your time.

147
00:08:59,437 --> 00:09:00,274
Atom.

148
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:02,567
Don’t worry about it.

149
00:09:02,848 --> 00:09:04,466
You didn’t mean to.

150
00:09:05,183 --> 00:09:05,807
Am I right?

151
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,389
It’s dark.

152
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:08,960
Let’s go home.

153
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:19,617
Mudmee, where do you live?

154
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:21,071
Near the grand market.

155
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,740
Whoa. That’s so far away.

156
00:09:24,194 --> 00:09:26,783
Kongthap, why don’t you take her…

157
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:27,502
Hey.

158
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,346
I'm passing along that direction.

159
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,518
You can ride home with me, Mudmee.

160
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,577
No way, Half.

161
00:09:32,694 --> 00:09:33,327
Why not?

162
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:36,173
Can you give her a ride? Where do you live?

163
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:37,219
Near the bus station.

164
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:38,180
Hey.

165
00:09:38,331 --> 00:09:39,616
Same direction as Atom’s house.

166
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,872
Please take care of him.

167
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:41,875
Let’s go, Mudmee.

168
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,983
- See you. - Bye, man.

169
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:44,503
See you.

170
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:50,722
Damn it.

171
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:53,545
Half.

172
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:00,238
Sorry.

173
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:02,120
You missed basketball practice because of me.

174
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,217
No worries.

175
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:05,665
It was fun today.

176
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:09,813
I forced you to join the art team

177
00:10:10,216 --> 00:10:11,604
and caused so much trouble.

178
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:13,108
Yet here you are comforting me.

179
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:17,423
You’re too nice.

180
00:10:19,684 --> 00:10:21,899
No, you are the nice one.

181
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:23,976
I’m not.

182
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:27,023
You asked me to join the team

183
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:29,214
because you were concerned Mudmee would have to work alone.

184
00:10:32,964 --> 00:10:36,260
And then you were worried when she lifted heavy things and asked how she’d get home.

185
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,706
You’re nice. That’s why I wanted to help you.

186
00:10:42,287 --> 00:10:42,863
You.

187
00:10:43,848 --> 00:10:44,629
Stop it.

188
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:47,105
I’m not as nice as you think.

189
00:10:47,696 --> 00:10:48,819
Stop being nice to me.

190
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,075
Why?

191
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,583
Even if I told you why,

192
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,663
you wouldn’t get it.

193
00:11:02,757 --> 00:11:04,214
I think you’ve got paint on your face.

194
00:11:29,518 --> 00:11:30,377
Are you crying?

195
00:11:31,653 --> 00:11:32,211
No.

196
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:33,026
I’m not.

197
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,151
I’m taking off now.

198
00:11:38,757 --> 00:11:39,531
Wait, Atom.

199
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:40,754
Atom.

200
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,514
(Mudmee: It was fun today.)

201
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:06,290
(Mudmee: And I got to spend time with the one I like.)

202
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:11,826
(At least what I set up for Mudmee went as planned.)

203
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:23,823
What should I do?

204
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:25,225
It’s such a mess now.

205
00:12:25,982 --> 00:12:28,675
We paint it white first, then other colors on top.

206
00:12:30,856 --> 00:12:31,825
(Whoa. Wait a minute.)

207
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,161
(Not the moments between Kongthap and me!)

208
00:12:34,364 --> 00:12:35,801
(How did it come to this?)

209
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:41,718
Are you crying?

210
00:13:08,611 --> 00:13:13,712
Guys, Toon and Tan have bad news for us.

211
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:22,105
Guys, we stayed up late night after night to rehearse

212
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:25,013
and then discovered we had influenza.

213
00:13:25,515 --> 00:13:27,511
We don’t think we will recover before the play.

214
00:13:28,582 --> 00:13:31,613
We feel so sorry, you guys.

215
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:35,979
Let’s just say we must find new people for the main characters.

216
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:41,703
And the art team is the only team with sufficient free time to fill the roles.

217
00:13:42,342 --> 00:13:43,216
That’s right.

218
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,312
And the only one on the team who can take the female lead role is…

219
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:54,257
Me?

220
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,408
No. I can’t do it.

221
00:13:56,497 --> 00:13:59,715
I usually get stage fright.

222
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:01,751
Can’t it be someone else?

223
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:03,162
It’s okay.

224
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:04,610
You will be able to do it after rehearsal.

225
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:16,662
Guys.

226
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:19,625
The Lady Cin role,

227
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:22,814
I’ll do it.

228
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:24,900
What?

229
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:27,247
I think the role suits me better.

230
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:30,477
Suit you better?

231
00:14:30,977 --> 00:14:32,269
Suit you better, my ass!

232
00:14:33,253 --> 00:14:35,580
The role is for a girl.

233
00:14:36,053 --> 00:14:36,776
Alright.

234
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,662
So Mudmee will play Lady Cin.

235
00:14:39,773 --> 00:14:41,617
Everyone, let’s cheer her up.

236
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,816
As for the lord, how about…

237
00:14:51,564 --> 00:14:52,208
Kongthap?

238
00:14:53,474 --> 00:14:55,008
Or maybe Atom?

239
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:57,262
Atom can’t handle it.

240
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,613
He gets tongue-tied when he’s nervous.

241
00:15:00,306 --> 00:15:01,813
Can you do it instead?

242
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:04,511
Yeah.

243
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:06,103
Sure.

244
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:07,357
I’ll play the lord.

245
00:15:07,884 --> 00:15:09,428
Give him a big clap, guys.

246
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:17,675
(It’s okay.)

247
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,611
(On the bright side, Mudmee will get to spend time with Kongthap.)

248
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,490
(Slave one.)

249
00:15:29,048 --> 00:15:31,505
Here’s the shoe, my lord.

250
00:15:41,946 --> 00:15:43,679
May I put it on for you, my lady?

251
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:43,770
(Lady Cin)
May I put it on for you, my lady?

252
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:45,010
(Lady Cin)

253
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:46,265
Hold on, Kongthap.

254
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:47,545
Let me do it myself.

255
00:15:47,693 --> 00:15:48,336
I feel bad.

256
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:49,158
Wait.

257
00:15:49,635 --> 00:15:50,847
What Kongthap?

258
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:52,223
He’s the lord.

259
00:15:52,477 --> 00:15:53,402
Sorry.

260
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:54,382
Let’s do it again.

261
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,722
From Mudmee’s line.

262
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:56,677
Three, two, one.

263
00:15:56,982 --> 00:15:58,306
Three, two, one.

264
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:00,371
For goodness’ sake.

265
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:02,500
Not to repeat him.

266
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:04,087
Repeat your own dialogue.

267
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,026
I’m sorry.

268
00:16:05,555 --> 00:16:06,530
I’m sorry, guys.

269
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,974
Let’s start over.

270
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:11,402
Excuse me.

271
00:16:12,423 --> 00:16:13,269
Yes, Mom.

272
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:14,302
Sure.

273
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:17,977
Guys, my mom called.

274
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:19,162
I need to run some errands for her.

275
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:20,583
Will you excuse me?

276
00:16:20,598 --> 00:16:21,607
I really am sorry.

277
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,339
I’ll study my lines at home.

278
00:16:23,423 --> 00:16:24,114
Sorry.

279
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:30,703
Alright then.

280
00:16:31,253 --> 00:16:32,364
Let’s call it a day.

281
00:16:33,031 --> 00:16:34,102
Or should we continue?

282
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:37,200
The female lead just left. How can we continue?

283
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:39,167
We will start again tomorrow.

284
00:16:39,392 --> 00:16:40,746
Don’t forget to do homework on your role.

285
00:16:41,195 --> 00:16:42,485
Let’s go home, guys.

286
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:43,308
Yes!

287
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:49,162
Go home.

288
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,330
(The Lord)

289
00:17:01,663 --> 00:17:02,468
Not going home?

290
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,057
Not yet.

291
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:08,709
I’ve got lots of lines.

292
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,795
I’ll stay and practice for a bit.

293
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,571
Want some help running lines?

294
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:31,216
It’s fine. I think I’ll manage.

295
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,515
I’m not helping you. I’m helping Mudmee.

296
00:17:35,394 --> 00:17:38,942
If you perform well, you can carry her through the show.

297
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:43,866
Okay?

298
00:17:44,694 --> 00:17:46,842
May I put this shoe on for you, my lady?

299
00:17:47,595 --> 00:17:49,303
Are you sure, my lord?

300
00:17:51,454 --> 00:17:52,082
Please.

301
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:53,305
I earnestly beg you.

302
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,151
You may do so then, my lord.

303
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:07,106
Hey.

304
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:08,823
What’s going on?

305
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:14,450
I don’t know.

306
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,709
I feel off every time we get to this scene.

307
00:18:19,718 --> 00:18:20,315
What?

308
00:18:21,128 --> 00:18:21,829
Why?

309
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:28,149
The script says that the lord looks into Lady Cin’s eyes and falls in love.

310
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:31,195
But they’ve just met.

311
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,444
How can they fall in love?

312
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:38,068
Sure they can.

313
00:18:39,506 --> 00:18:42,851
Love doesn’t take time.

314
00:18:52,358 --> 00:18:53,737
All it takes is just one smile.

315
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,168
That’s it.

316
00:18:57,122 --> 00:18:58,866
That’s all it takes to fall in love.

317
00:19:03,053 --> 00:19:03,871
How do you know?

318
00:19:05,075 --> 00:19:05,980
Have I ever smiled at you?

319
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,315
Gosh.

320
00:19:11,327 --> 00:19:14,518
I heard it from a love guru’s radio station.

321
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:15,457
Just forget it.

322
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,360
Let’s do this.

323
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,509
Imagine the person in front of you is someone

324
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,801
you’ve been looking for for so long.

325
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:34,368
I will try.

326
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,930
Alright.

327
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,210
Ready?

328
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:49,974
Three, two, one.

329
00:20:22,657 --> 00:20:23,373
Do you feel it yet?

330
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,505
I do.

331
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:31,613
I feel like this is so hard.

332
00:20:32,717 --> 00:20:33,697
I can never get it.

333
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,688
I’ll go home and practice the rest.

334
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,690
(Destirella, Grade 11 Class 3, 3:30 p.m.)

335
00:21:05,749 --> 00:21:10,282
- Please come and see Destirella by Grade 11 Class 3.
- Please swing by, guys.

336
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:13,946
Is Kongthap not here yet?

337
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:16,903
He isn’t.

338
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:34,528
Sorry.

339
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,158
It took quite long to fix the outfit.

340
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:40,511
What is it?

341
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:55,182
Hurry up, guys.

342
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,162
The audience is coming.

343
00:21:57,177 --> 00:21:58,142
We must hurry.

344
00:21:58,478 --> 00:21:59,051
Chop-chop.

345
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:00,508
Yes. Put it right there.

346
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:01,880
Yes, over here.

347
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,437
Get more stuff from the back.

348
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:04,161
There are more.

349
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:05,468
Hang it.

350
00:22:05,768 --> 00:22:07,371
We need one more right here.

351
00:22:08,754 --> 00:22:10,306
Can you check the tablecloth? It doesn’t look so good.

352
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,011
When you’re done with that, put it here.

353
00:22:13,168 --> 00:22:14,518
Okay. Great.

354
00:22:14,794 --> 00:22:16,017
Get the clothes and pillows from the back.

355
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:18,657
What am I going to do?

356
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:21,213
It’s starting in five minutes.

357
00:22:22,434 --> 00:22:24,505
Mudmee, Calm down.

358
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,715
It’s fine.

359
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,220
Just do it like how you practiced it.

360
00:22:30,157 --> 00:22:31,717
What if I forget the lines?

361
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,908
What if I embarrass everyone?

362
00:22:46,253 --> 00:22:49,912
Mother, don’t you think the color is too noticeable?

363
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:51,691
Noticeable is great.

364
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:57,611
It will get the lord to choose you as his dance partner at the ball tonight.

365
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:05,712
Where is Cin anyway?

366
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:07,983
Why isn’t she here to prepare my daughters’ shoes?

367
00:23:09,397 --> 00:23:10,202
Cin.

368
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,722
Cin, where are you?

369
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,282
Cin.

370
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:15,093
Cin.

371
00:23:15,182 --> 00:23:15,831
Mudmee.

372
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,241
- It’s your queue. - I’m sorry.

373
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:18,075
Just a sec.

374
00:23:18,968 --> 00:23:19,866
Are you okay?

375
00:23:19,884 --> 00:23:20,776
I am.

376
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:21,831
Take a deep breath.

377
00:23:21,847 --> 00:23:22,711
Cin, where are you?

378
00:23:24,284 --> 00:23:25,179
Cin.

379
00:23:29,571 --> 00:23:30,854
Where are you, Cin?

380
00:23:33,785 --> 00:23:34,505
Cin!

381
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,325
Here I am, my lady.

382
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,311
Well…

383
00:23:48,853 --> 00:23:51,414
Cin isn’t available tonight.

384
00:23:53,785 --> 00:23:57,703
I, Soduang,

385
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:01,170
will be at your service instead, my ladies.

386
00:24:18,628 --> 00:24:21,031
We’re going to the ball tonight.

387
00:24:21,282 --> 00:24:22,699
You stay home.

388
00:24:22,903 --> 00:24:24,709
If we come back to find this house untidy,

389
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:28,059
you will be whipped.

390
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:31,306
Someone like you will never get a chance to attend the ball.

391
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:32,601
That’s right, you slave.

392
00:24:34,143 --> 00:24:34,915
Off we go, my darlings.

393
00:25:09,961 --> 00:25:14,111
 Gazing at the sky, night and day 

394
00:25:15,373 --> 00:25:19,389
 There's one thing my heart wants to say 

395
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:23,431
 Life's beauty like the dawn's first light 

396
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,231
 Will it ever shine on me, so bright 

397
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:29,853
 Will I ever feel its warm array? 

398
00:25:31,428 --> 00:25:35,154
 Is it wrong if I dream a while? 

399
00:25:36,623 --> 00:25:40,568
 One day, upon me, luck will smile 

400
00:25:42,122 --> 00:25:44,765
 With love, with arms to hold me tight 

401
00:25:44,797 --> 00:25:47,451
 No one who means harm in sight 

402
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:50,582
 Telling myself in the meanwhile 

403
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:56,063
 That someone out there's on their way 

404
00:25:56,408 --> 00:26:01,447
 Destiny will lead them to stay 

405
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:06,911
 Someone for me to lean on 

406
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:12,426
 To embrace my heart from this moment on 

407
00:26:12,795 --> 00:26:17,306
 That someone, among many, I wait for 

408
00:26:17,998 --> 00:26:22,871
 No matter how far the distance lies before 

409
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:26,791
 Even if it takes forever long 

410
00:26:27,414 --> 00:26:31,974
 My body and soul know all along 

411
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:37,250
 There’s someone out there for me 

412
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:02,915
Damn.

413
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,392
I want to go to the ball too.

414
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,469
Did you just ask for me?

415
00:27:19,186 --> 00:27:19,813
Hey!

416
00:27:20,524 --> 00:27:21,207
You!

417
00:27:21,527 --> 00:27:24,106
Are you a thief?

418
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:26,722
No thief can be this handsome.

419
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:30,275
I am an angel.

420
00:27:31,195 --> 00:27:34,625
I heard your wish.

421
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,583
In recognition of all your good deeds,

422
00:27:37,742 --> 00:27:40,816
I will grant your wish.

423
00:27:42,342 --> 00:27:45,694
Abra, abra, abracadabra!

424
00:27:45,906 --> 00:27:47,597
Abra, abra, bra, bra, bra!

425
00:27:59,228 --> 00:28:00,656
The ball is starting soon.

426
00:28:01,034 --> 00:28:03,008
Why are you still here, my son?

427
00:28:04,365 --> 00:28:07,808
I appreciate you throwing the ball in the hopes that I find my soulmate.

428
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,810
However, I’m not certain.

429
00:28:16,265 --> 00:28:18,814
How can I tell which one I want?

430
00:28:20,546 --> 00:28:21,305
It’s simple.

431
00:28:21,872 --> 00:28:24,060
You will know it when the time comes.

432
00:28:46,213 --> 00:28:48,512
 If you weren’t me, you’d never know 

433
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,857
 Perfect image for show 

434
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,672
 But inside my heart, there’s a woe 

435
00:28:53,694 --> 00:28:55,611
 Empty and hollow 

436
00:28:55,814 --> 00:28:58,053
 Surrounded by plenty, yet something’s missing 

437
00:28:58,223 --> 00:29:00,453
 Crowded by many, but lonely within 

438
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,213
 Each morning, I wake with gloom looming 

439
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:05,597
 As if cursed by fate’s vengeance 

440
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:08,850
 Yet still, I haven’t lost my hope 

441
00:29:08,965 --> 00:29:14,115
 Someone will come from heaven above 

442
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:18,989
 Someone who gives my days true meaning 

443
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:23,791
 Filling the void my heart's been feeling 

444
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:30,647
 Making me cease my endless seeking 

445
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:38,637
 The final verse, a perfect ending 

446
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:45,891
 Someone for whom I am looking 

447
00:29:51,654 --> 00:29:59,478
 I believe that someone is out there 

448
00:30:15,924 --> 00:30:16,718
So?

449
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:19,404
Have you found a lady you’re interested in?

450
00:30:19,863 --> 00:30:22,605
I think a daughter from that household is not bad.

451
00:30:23,872 --> 00:30:24,509
Oh, gosh.

452
00:30:27,134 --> 00:30:28,819
Rain, couldn't you pick a better time?

453
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,915
Good evening.

454
00:30:43,601 --> 00:30:46,204
Would you be interested in dancing with me to a song?

455
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,444
You are an aristocratic nobleman.

456
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,453
Why would you want to dance with me?

457
00:30:53,594 --> 00:30:57,124
Do I need a reason for that?

458
00:31:00,688 --> 00:31:01,370
Alright then.

459
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,503
One song, my lord.

460
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:20,518
 This is not a dream, I'm standing here 

461
00:31:21,235 --> 00:31:23,435
 Before you 

462
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:29,687
 But if it was a dream, it’d be the best reverie 

463
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:33,862
 I’ve ever experienced so true 

464
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:39,974
 And then it will dawn on you 

465
00:31:41,682 --> 00:31:46,229
 As if you awakened from the lonesome blues 

466
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,899
 Vanished in an instant 

467
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:56,592
 When you look into my eyes, euphonic tunes 

468
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,339
 Begin with brilliance 

469
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,122
 A new life 

470
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,720
 A new world as imagined now realized 

471
00:32:05,688 --> 00:32:06,635
 This is love 

472
00:32:06,653 --> 00:32:07,813
 Beautiful and bright 

473
00:32:07,823 --> 00:32:08,865
 Been searching for 

474
00:32:08,877 --> 00:32:09,862
 At first sight 

475
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:13,554
 Like every wish and desire fulfilled 

476
00:32:13,788 --> 00:32:15,198
 No loneliness 

477
00:32:15,211 --> 00:32:16,265
 No sorrow 

478
00:32:16,275 --> 00:32:21,525
 Only happiness and joy follow 

479
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,069
 Wishing this moment 

480
00:32:24,085 --> 00:32:26,493
 Would pause and hold still 

481
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,050
 Let two hearts meet 

482
00:32:28,069 --> 00:32:33,768
 And dreams fulfilled 

483
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:43,201
 Never want this moment to pass by 

484
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:50,131
 Never want this night to end and fade away 

485
00:32:50,145 --> 00:32:52,688
 Fade away 

486
00:32:58,244 --> 00:33:10,460
 For I wish our hearts forever entwined, together we stay 

487
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,204
The song is over.

488
00:34:01,616 --> 00:34:02,300
Right.

489
00:34:05,035 --> 00:34:06,823
I apologize, my lord.

490
00:34:07,121 --> 00:34:09,367
I have to go.

491
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:12,250
Please, wait.

492
00:34:12,478 --> 00:34:13,810
Atom, the shoe.

493
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:15,182
You must leave the shoe.

494
00:34:15,296 --> 00:34:16,106
The shoe!

495
00:34:16,182 --> 00:34:17,100
The shoe!

496
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:19,690
Oh.

497
00:34:20,765 --> 00:34:21,457
Right.

498
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,614
I’m sorry about the play.

499
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,909
I couldn’t be of much help.

500
00:35:12,605 --> 00:35:16,068
And thank you, Atom, for rescuing the day.

501
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:17,573
Come on.

502
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,614
Don’t feel bad, Mudmee.

503
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,337
It’s our fault for forcing you into it.

504
00:35:23,072 --> 00:35:25,010
Anyway, we managed to get through it.

505
00:35:25,177 --> 00:35:27,265
It’s time to celebrate, guys.

506
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,120
Let’s eat.

507
00:35:33,074 --> 00:35:33,740
Atom.

508
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:35,709
Yeah?

509
00:35:36,173 --> 00:35:39,008
I didn’t know you two could sing that well.

510
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:39,906
Especially you, Atom.

511
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:42,268
I don’t actually sing that well.

512
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:46,059
All the credits go to Kongthap.

513
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,736
Compliment each other, huh?

514
00:35:50,512 --> 00:35:52,810
You two deserve the hashtag #KongthapAtom.

515
00:35:53,128 --> 00:35:53,862
A round of applause.

516
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,844
It’s not like that.

517
00:36:00,434 --> 00:36:02,616
Seriously, do you like each other?

518
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:04,272
You looked at each other so sweet.

519
00:36:04,555 --> 00:36:05,705
You must feel something.

520
00:36:06,271 --> 00:36:06,911
Right?

521
00:36:07,314 --> 00:36:09,188
I just said it’s not like that.

522
00:36:09,448 --> 00:36:13,207
When he held you in his arms, the lingering in your eyes showed.

523
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,591
I said we’re not like that!

524
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:15,619
Come on.

525
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:16,998
Take it easy.

526
00:36:17,493 --> 00:36:18,909
We’re just joking.

527
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:20,361
Why so serious?

528
00:36:20,425 --> 00:36:23,442
Besides, it can never happen anyway.

529
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,274
Right, guys?

530
00:36:24,352 --> 00:36:24,983
Right.

531
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:25,856
Right, Kongthap?

532
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,817
How is joking about this funny to you?

533
00:36:30,345 --> 00:36:32,171
Besides, Atom saved our class’s play.

534
00:36:32,905 --> 00:36:33,807
How is it funny?

535
00:36:34,798 --> 00:36:36,758
We didn’t mean it that way?

536
00:36:37,047 --> 00:36:37,909
What did you mean then?

537
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:43,838
Well said, Kongthap.

538
00:36:44,274 --> 00:36:46,217
You guys and your toxic masculinity can leave.

539
00:36:46,314 --> 00:36:46,865
So annoying.

540
00:36:46,988 --> 00:36:47,877
Leave.

541
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:48,727
Go!

542
00:36:49,785 --> 00:36:51,210
Get out of here.

543
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:55,080
Don’t mind them.

544
00:36:55,533 --> 00:36:56,619
Let’s continue our party.

545
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,934
Guys.

546
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:05,565
The fireworks show for the ending ceremony is starting.

547
00:37:05,654 --> 00:37:06,408
Let’s go see it.

548
00:37:06,536 --> 00:37:07,263
Come on.

549
00:37:07,274 --> 00:37:08,133
I’m coming too.

550
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:34,168
Aren’t you going?

551
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:37,207
Hey.

552
00:37:37,607 --> 00:37:39,410
Don’t be so serious.

553
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,466
They might get mad at you.

554
00:37:43,237 --> 00:37:45,056
Do you like what they said?

555
00:37:46,882 --> 00:37:47,714
Just forget it.

556
00:37:50,814 --> 00:37:52,370
I don’t like what they said to you.

557
00:37:55,379 --> 00:37:56,262
I’m sorry

558
00:37:57,755 --> 00:37:59,161
if I made you feel uncomfortable.

559
00:38:05,802 --> 00:38:06,706
You don’t need to apologize.

560
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,463
You were angry for me.

561
00:38:27,629 --> 00:38:28,611
(Damn it.)

562
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:31,115
(Why did I give him that response?)

563
00:38:31,825 --> 00:38:35,314
(It's even more reason for Kongthap to think I like him.)

564
00:38:40,213 --> 00:38:40,859
Atom!

565
00:38:50,088 --> 00:38:51,075
That was close.

566
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,573
Let’s pick up your bike.

567
00:39:04,065 --> 00:39:05,614
You seem depressed.

568
00:39:06,134 --> 00:39:07,831
Is something on your mind?

569
00:39:09,411 --> 00:39:10,084
Oh.

570
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:11,511
No.

571
00:39:12,595 --> 00:39:13,631
Nothing at all, Mudmee.

572
00:39:13,914 --> 00:39:17,271
I’m just thinking about random stuff.

573
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,312
Are you sure?

574
00:39:21,328 --> 00:39:22,564
There must be something.

575
00:39:27,986 --> 00:39:31,374
Yeah, but I’m okay.

576
00:39:32,611 --> 00:39:34,302
Don’t worry about me.

577
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,260
Of course, I’m worried. We’re friends.

578
00:39:37,748 --> 00:39:41,309
Besides, when I had problems, you helped me.

579
00:39:41,657 --> 00:39:43,807
So whatever it is, you can tell me.

580
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,201
I’m willing to help.

581
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:51,542
Mudmee.

582
00:39:53,368 --> 00:39:54,108
What is it?

583
00:39:57,096 --> 00:40:00,957
I once promised to help you with your love.

584
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:02,900
Yeah.

585
00:40:04,774 --> 00:40:05,980
I don’t think I can do it

586
00:40:08,453 --> 00:40:09,920
if I still feel this way.

587
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,232
I’m sorry.

588
00:40:22,343 --> 00:40:23,700
The one you like,

589
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,232
I like him too.

590
00:40:27,808 --> 00:40:28,413
What?

591
00:40:29,423 --> 00:40:30,219
Wait a minute.

592
00:40:30,948 --> 00:40:32,611
Does that mean…

593
00:40:33,727 --> 00:40:36,263
you like Half too?

594
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,608
That’s right.

595
00:40:41,245 --> 00:40:41,880
What?

596
00:40:42,558 --> 00:40:45,103
Mudmee, isn’t Kongthap the one you like?

597
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,272
What?

598
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,918
What about the name ‘Kongthap’ on your eraser?

599
00:40:53,487 --> 00:40:56,511
Oh. It’s not Kongthap’s name.

600
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:59,773
I wrote Half’s first name on the eraser.

601
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,246
(Pholkongthap.)

602
00:41:03,247 --> 00:41:05,677
Ah! I get it now.
(Pholkongthap.)

603
00:41:05,678 --> 00:41:06,071
(Pholkongthap.)

604
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:06,250
Half’s dad is in the military.
(Pholkongthap.)

605
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:08,302
Half’s dad is in the military.

606
00:41:08,506 --> 00:41:10,915
That’s why he named him ‘Pholkongthap’ which means ‘Army.’

607
00:41:11,905 --> 00:41:13,808
How could I forget that?

608
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,868
So you saw ‘Kongthap’ on my eraser

609
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:20,601
because it had been used till ‘Phol’ was gone, right?

610
00:41:21,505 --> 00:41:22,143
Wait!

611
00:41:22,485 --> 00:41:25,608
So the one you like is Kongthap?

612
00:41:32,528 --> 00:41:33,308
Don’t worry.

613
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:35,536
From now on, I’ll help you.

614
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,238
(Kongthap)

615
00:42:17,238 --> 00:42:17,930
Atom, you must first write Kongthap's name on your eraser.
(Kongthap)

616
00:42:17,931 --> 00:42:19,694
Atom, you must first write Kongthap's name on your eraser.

617
00:42:19,711 --> 00:42:21,241
Don’t forget to look at his face.

618
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,682
The more you use it,

619
00:42:22,696 --> 00:42:25,217
the closer you'll get to the one you like.

620
00:42:25,432 --> 00:42:25,977
I’m leaving.

621
00:42:25,988 --> 00:42:27,715
Mudmee, you can leave with him.

622
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:31,136
I don’t know what happened to me.

623
00:42:31,997 --> 00:42:33,783
You've taken up space in my head.

624
00:42:34,045 --> 00:42:37,370
I’m sorry if I made you feel bad.

625
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:41,711
Knowing that you think of me sometimes makes us even.

626
00:42:42,819 --> 00:42:43,903
Atom, you’ve got a problem.

627
00:42:44,278 --> 00:42:45,709
Kongthap likes you.

628
00:42:45,865 --> 00:42:46,457
What?
